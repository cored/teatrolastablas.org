  <p>Tablas is a term used in Spanish to refer to a stage or to indicate experience performing and speaking in public. Las Tablas is committed to promoting cultural and community affairs through workshops, forums, the publishing of audio, visual and written work, and above all, the presentation of theater works and above all, the presentation of theater works. Our works will lead us to explore new ideas and generate dialogue concerning the realities faced by our individual clients and communities. We serve the individual artist, artist groups, individual residents, and groups of residents in the Washington Heights/Inwood area as well as other interested communities. We provide a space to reflect, create, collaborate, and to develop solutions to personal and community matters. We support theater work that explores culture, identity and integration. We encourage personal exploration, community involvement, and social activism.</p>
